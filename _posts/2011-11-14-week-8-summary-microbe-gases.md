Greetings microbe adopters! Wow, time has really been flying by for the scientists on this Expedition. Please accept our humblest apologies for the delay in posting the results of your [week 8 experiments]({{"/2011/10/31/week-8-activity-microbe-farts/" | absolute_url }})!! We were so busy with handling new fresh cores of sticky gooey sediment from the bottom of the ocean, we didn't even have time to wash our hands to write the next posts.

So, without further ado, here are some of the photos that you sent in of your awesome 'microbe farts' experiments. First up, here is a photo of the yeast gas experiment done by the NASSA gang. One of their bottles contained sugary drink mix, and the other one sugar-free drink mix - can you guess which one is which?

The rock stars at Saginaw High School set up their yeast gas experiments in some nice looking Erlenmeyer flasks.  They tested the growth of yeast with plain sugar, apple juice, and Tampico.  Apparently the smell of the Tampico and yeast experiment was pretty bad - yuck!

Next up, we have a series of photos of the students at Trinity Lutheran conducting their microbe farts experiments.  Thankfully, most of their experiments just ended up smelling like bread!  We really like the last photo of some of the students standing in front of a drawing of the _JOIDES Resolution_ with their mighty microbe!

Thanks to everyone that participated in this activity! Later today, we will post the 9th and final activity for this Adopt A Microbe project - stay tuned!
