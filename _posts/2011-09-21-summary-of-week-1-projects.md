Greetings from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, microbe adopters! Thank you so much for sending in pictures of your awesome microbe models for the [week 1 activity]({{"/2011/09/12/first-activity/" | absolute_url}}).

To start off with, Gabriel sent in this shadowy conception of [_Methanocaldococcus jannaschii_]({{"2011/09/16/introduction-to-methanocaldococcus-jannaschii/" | absolute_url}}).

And Joaquin has a nice interpretation of [_Arcobacter sulfidicus_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=218).

One of the CyberExplorers made this neat model of [_Mariprofundus ferrooxydans_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=382). The CyberExplorers also had some questions about their microbe. They ask, "Are the ribbon like stalks flagella, or used for movement?"  _Mariprofundus_ does have flagella, but not within the stalk. It is thought that the flagella might be used when the little kidney bean-shaped cells break off of the stalks and 'swim' away. Otherwise, the cell 'moves' by adding more stalk material to the end closest to the cell, with the other end anchored somewhere else. There is actually a lot of curiosity in the scientific world to try to understand how the stalks are made and what function they serve.

The CyberExplorers were also interested to know if bacteria, in general, can be parasitic or beneficial, and if they get eaten. The short answer, in general, is yes to all three. However, _Mariprofundus_ is not a parasite, and, to my knowledge, no one has studied if something eats _Mariprofundus_ (although at other hydrothermal vents, animals are known to 'graze' on mats of bacteria).

Jacob and Thomas sent in their models of [_Shewanella loihica_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=250) and [_Marinobacter aquaeolei_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=225), and they had these questions: 'Why are there so few microbes that like the cold? Can my microbe survive out of water? What color are they?'

![AAMv4_week1_04]({{ "/assets/Hillis_ShewMarino-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

To the first question, actually, when you think about how enormous the ocean is, and that most of the water in the ocean is pretty cold, then there are actually a ton of organisms that live in the cold. Our adoption list has a lot of heat-loving organisms because some of them have pretty amazing abilities to survive under extreme conditions. To the second question, the answer is sort of.  Scientists can preserve cells in the freezer after drying them in a special way, and then the cells can be grown again. As to the color of the microbes, I'll have to check on that and get back to you. I know that _Marinobacter_ tends to become a pale yellowy brown color when it is grown in culture, but I don't know about _Shewanella_.

The kids over at NASSA sent in this rad photo of their microbe - [_Thiomargarita_]({{"/2011/09/14/introduction-to-thiomargarita/" | absolute_url }}) - in front of the flag of Namibia, to symbolize where the microbe was first discovered.  Although I wouldn't want to eat the real _Thiomargarita_, those microbes look like a tasty treat!

Students from Saginaw High School adopted a whole bunch of microbes - here are some examples of their models.

About _Methanocaldococcus jannaschii,_ they had these questions: "Can this microbe make an animal sick like _E. coli_ or _Salmonella_? Has it evolved or genetically changed any since its first discovery?" To the first question, I would first point out that not all _E. coli_ or _Salmonella_ are dangerous, only certain strains of these species are problematic. In fact, you probably have a couple thousand _E. coil_ living in your guts right now! But regardless, as far as I know, _Methanococcus_ is not harmful to animals. Other microbes that are closely related to _Methanococcus jannaschii_ (sort of like cousins) actually live in the guts of cows and termites and make the methane gas that they emit (by burping or farting). I apologize that I do not know so much about the genetic evolution in _Methanococcus_ cultured strains. I'll look into it and get back to you.

The gang over at Trinity Lutheran sent in these models and questions about _Marinobacter_: "If iron reacts with oxygen to form rust, how does the microbe produce rust?

![AAMv4_week1_22]({{ "/assets/Yoh_MarinobacterSavana-208x118.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Great question! The microbes have to come up with some interesting tricks to capture the energy from iron oxidation before it reacts abiotically. Where these microbes are found, in the cold and at relatively low oxygen concentrations, the microbes can catalyze the reaction between iron and oxygen faster than 'rust' would form on its own. As to the biochemical mechanism that the microbes use to make the 'rust' on their stalks, stay tuned - this is an active area of scientific investigation!

Other members of Trinity Lutheran adopted _Thiomargarita namibiensis_, which they stylized as "Elvis is not dead, he is near Namibia."

Not to be outdone, a big high five to the students from Calabasas, CA, for their amazingly creative models of all kinds of adopted microbes. Thanks!!

Thanks again for making such interesting microbe models!!  And don't forget to send in some photos by Monday from your mud collection for the [week 2 activity]({{"/2011/09/19/second-activity/" | absolute_url}})!
