Greetings microbe lovers!  In today’s post, we are going to get to know another one of the microbes in our [Adoption Center](/adoptamicrobe/?cat_ID=17) – the fabulous [_**Thiomargarita namibiensis**_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=253)!

![Thiomarg_01]({{ "/assets/Thiomarg_01-208x179.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Now, when I say the word ‘microbe’, what are some of the first words that you think of?  Small?  Tiny? Microscope? Awesome? Well, prepare to be amazed – _Thiomargarita_ is a ‘microbe’ that you could see with your own eyes (well, if you could go down to the bottom of the ocean)!  Check out this picture where you can see _Thiomargarita_ next to an insect !!

That’s right. _Thiomargarita_ is a mighty giant among the teenies, clocking in at up to three-quarters of a millimeter (that’s about 1/32 of an inch). _Thiomargarita nambiensis_ looks like little off white balls connected in a string. Other species of _Thiomargarita_ occur on their own, but they are still giants. In fact, _Thiomargarita_ are so big, there may even be [fossils of them preserved in 600-million-year old rocks](http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2213/the-great-preserver)! ![Thiomarg_02]({{ "/assets/Thiomarg_02-208x225.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

![Thiomarg_03]({{ "/assets/thiomarg_03.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Why are _Thiomargarita_ so big, and what’s with the name? Well, if you were to look at _Thiomargarita_ close up and with fancy microscopes, you would see that a large part of the cell is just a big balloon full of liquid, while the rest of the stuff that makes up the cell is concentrated on the periphery. These microbes can ‘breathe’ nitrate, which they concentrate inside the balloon to eat later on. When they are ‘breathing’ nitrate, they are also eating sulfur to get energy, and they store the sulfur in little globs on the periphery of the cell – this is what gives the cells their off white color. These microbes were first discovered by a team of German scientists in some super stinky mud collected off of the coast of Namibia, Africa. If you were to translate _Thiomargarita_’s name from Greek and Latin, you would roughly get ‘sulfur pearl of Namibia’. Tada!

Did you know that there are other microbes that you could see with your eyes? Another group of giant bacteria that also use sulfur are called the _Beggiatoa_. They are often found in thick mats on the seafloor – [**check out this video**](http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/visions11/file/ROPOS+Dive+1461+Highlights+-+Core+Samples) to get an idea of big these mats can be.
