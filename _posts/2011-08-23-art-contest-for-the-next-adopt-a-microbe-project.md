Greetings microbe lovers!  In preparation for the next Adopt A Microbe project, which will coincide with the [next deep biosphere expedition](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/midatlantic_ridge_microbio.html) of the _JOIDES Resolution_ starting in mid-September, we are happy to announce an art contest!  We will be decorating the new CORKs that will be installed at the bottom of the ocean, and your art work could be featured on them!  Check out the flier for more details!
