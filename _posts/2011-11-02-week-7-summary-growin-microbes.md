Greetings microbe adopters! We hope that you had fun growing microbe colonies on your agar plates for last week's activity. Here are some of the photos that you sent in.

The gang over at Trinity Lutheran worked in teams to transfer mud from their Winogradsky columns onto the growth plates. We can't wait to hear more about your results!

The NASSA gang in New York were able to grow lots of microbe colonies on their agar plates. They inoculated their plates with mud from different depths in their Winogradsky column - what kind of differences and similarities do you see between the microbe colonies that grew?

Many of the microbiologists on our cruise are also trying to culture different microbes from the rocks and sediments we are collecting. Wish us luck that we find some new and cool stuff!

***UPDATE:*** Here a few photos sent in from the microbe adopters in Quesnel, Canada. As you can see, they have set up a lot of culturing plates with the mud from their Winogradsky columns.
