Greetings microbe friends!  After 4 days of traveling at full speed, the JOIDES Resolution finally arrived at our first research station in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  We are at 22 degrees 45.3′ N latitude and 46 degrees 5.3′ W longitude - check out the [live map here](http://joidesresolution.org/node/9).  The water depth here is approximately 4500 meters, or roughly 2.8 miles!  It takes many, many hours for the drill string to be assembled to reach the seafloor, and since it has been raining off and on ([Tropical Storm Ophelia](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) is just to the south of us), it takes even longer.

In between the rain bursts, some of us have been out on the deck, decorating the observatories that we hope to install at the bottom of the ocean later in the expedition.

These [observatories]({{"/2011/09/1/let-the-fun-begin/" | absolute_url}}) will help to study all of the crazy awesome microbial life below the seafloor in this part of the ocean.  But before we get to know more about those deep, dark dwellers, maybe it would be fun to learn a little but more about microbial life in the rest of the ocean first.

The fine folks at the **Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education** at the University of Hawaii have developed some [cool online resources](http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/education.htm) (including quizzes! and prizes! and [videos](http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/education/animation.htm)!) to help you learn about the various microbes floating around in the ocean.  Head on over to take the [Microbe IQ and Microbe Personality Quiz](http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/education/kidskorner/index.htm), then send us a message (or leave a comment) to let us know which microbe you are.
