Howdy microbe lovers! A huge thanks to all of you for sending in such awesome photos of your sampling sites and Winogradsky columns for the [week 2 project]({{"/2011/09/19/second-activity/" | absolute_url}})!! So cool! Here are some of the photos you sent in:

The 4th grade class from Florida sampled some shallow water grassy pools to set up their column. The dark brown color in their column indicates that there is probably a lot of organic matter in the mud they collected, which will be very yummy for the microbes that will grow.

The NASSA gang from New York collected their mud from the shores of Lake Delta.

Joan and her gang in Granbury, TX, collected some nice reddish mud from around Lake Granbury. The reddish color probably comes from iron oxides in the mud.

The Cyber Explorer from New Jersey is trying a cool experiment comparing the microbes that will grow in mud from two different places. Here are pictures of the collection at a lakeside in Birch Grove Park and at the beach in Longport, NJ. Which type of mud do you think will have the fastest growing microbes?

Check out this variety pack of muddy columns from the champs over at Saginaw High School in Texas! Considering that Texas has been in a very long drought this summer, finding a body of muddy water to sample is pretty tough. For example, some of the samples were collected from drainage areas like the one below. I think it'll be interesting to see how each of the different Winogradsky columns will develop. Keep track of what you see developing over the next few weeks!

An 8th grade science glass from British Columbia, Canada, collected their mud from banks of the Fraser River in Quesnel. Love the fall colors of the trees in the background! Out here at sea, the sight of trees is sorely missed.

Tom and Jake from Texas collected some mud that already has some color in it.  Check out the little mats of bright green on the surface of their mud.  There must already be some photosynthetic microbes living in their samples.  It'll be interesting to see how the color changes over the next few weeks.

Next up are some of the many photos that the rock stars from the North Hollywood Zoo Magnet high school sent in from their mud and microbe collection in the LA River.  How cool that you brought your microbe models along for the photo shoot!

And here are some shots of the sampling done for the marine science classes from Nobel Middle School in Northridge, California. Looks like the water was a little stagnant and the mud is dark brown - I bet that there are a lot of anaerobic microbes in that column of mud!

And we also have word that the cool cats over at Trinity Lutheran did some sample collecting, but we are having some technical issues getting their photos - stay tuned for an update from them.

_UPDATE: Check out this Winogradsky column assembly - awesome!_

Thanks again for sending in your photos! Sounds like you all had a lot of fun digging in the mud for microbes! We can't wait to see what develops in your Winogradsky columns!! We hope that you enjoy the [microbe math project]({{"/2011/09/26/3rd-activity-microbe-math" | absolute_url }}) for this week, and stay tuned for a contest question later today.
