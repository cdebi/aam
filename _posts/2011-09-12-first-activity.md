Greetings, Adopt A Microbe participants! We are very excited to announce the first activity associated with the Adopt A Microbe Project version 4.0! To start off, we’ll give you a few more details about the voyage that will set sail in a few days, and then you’ll find information about this week’s activity. Let’s get started!

All across the world, scientists are packing their suitcases in preparation to sail on the magnificent [_JOIDES Resolution_](http://joidesresolution.org/node/8) – a gigantic research vessel that is 143 meters (469 feet) long (longer than a football field!) with a drilling derrick that rises 62 meters (205 feet) above the water. Starting on 17 September, this vessel will be their cozy home-away-from-home for the next two months. Unlike big luxury cruises that ply the Atlantic Ocean with tourists aboard, with swimming pools and dance clubs and game rooms (oh my!), this voyage will be heading for one spot in the middle of the Atlantic and then sitting there for weeks on end, drilling down into the seabed in search of new forms of life. As we mentioned in an **[earlier post on the Giant Microbe blog]({{"/2011/09/11/let-the-fun-begin" | absolute_url }})**, we are curious to study the microbes living in the oceanic crust formed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

![]({{ "/assets/Picture-11-208x96.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Using a giant drilling vessel is a rather crude way to investigate the seafloor, but it is currently one of the only tools we have for collecting deeply buried samples. Sometimes, ocean scientists can also use high-tech cameras mounted on awesome submarines to explore the seafloor. Recently, many teams of scientists were exploring the [seafloor of the Pacific Ocean](http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/visions11), in search of new habitats and life around a recently erupted underwater volcano. There, new seafloor in the form of [_basaltic lavas_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) had just been formed – a seafloor surface analogue of the type of environment we will be trying to sample through drilling on our expedition. Those other scientists were very nice and posted some **really amazing [high-definition videos](http://www.interactiveoceans.washington.edu/visions11/video)** on their website from their submersible dives. In them, you can see the bumpy new seafloor rocks, rusty crusts, hot water, weird animals, and so much more. For us, one of the coolest things is to imagine all of the microbes that are colonizing the rocks.  We bet that there are bunches of cool iron eating bacteria – like [_Mariprofundus ferrooxydans_]({{"/2013/03/21/adoption-center-microbes" | absolute_url}}) in our Adoption Center – living in those rusty crusts!

![]({{ "/assets/Mariprofundus2-208x124.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} The scientists of this cruise are very excited to explore the rocks below the Atlantic Ocean to see if microbes like _Mariprofundus_ are living there.  These microbes ‘breathe’ oxygen and iron to gain energy, and they produce very intricate twisted stalks of rust as they grow.  Some friends of ours recently made some cool movies of these microbes – check them out [on the web](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02567.x/suppinfo) to see really close up details of how the stalks are formed.  To give you a taste of what the movies are like, here is one of the videos, showing Mariprofundus growing and making a twisted stalk.

Over the next few days, we’ll be posting more information about some of the other microbes in our Adoption Center, to help you get to know them better.  In the meantime, you can get started on your own, looking up information on the Internet about the microbe you have adopted.  We’ve provided links below to help get you started.

**For this week’s activity**, after learning a little bit about your adopted microbe, we would like you to send us 1-2 questions that you might have about your microbe, and we would also like you to send us a picture of what you think your microbe looks like in 3D.  You can use play dough, balloons, or any other material you can think of to make a model of your microbe.

Before you get started, if you feel like you need a little more background on what 'microbes'; are, here are some websites that you might find useful.  (please note that a lot of websites will focus on medical microbiology, and less on microbes in the environment, but much of the information is still relevant).

  * Here is a nice [interactive tutorial](http://www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk/interactives/science/microorganisms/whatandwhere.asp) that explains what a 'microorganism'; is, and the different types (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) that you can find in the environment
  * The same site also has [another tutorial](http://www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk/interactives/science/microorganisms/whatarebacteria.asp) specifically about bacteria and what they are
  * [The Virtual Museum of Bacteria](http://www.bacteriamuseum.org/cms/Bacteria/what-are-bacteria.html) gives some nice background on bacteria, and how there are both pathogenic bacteria (the kind that can make you sick) and other more beneficial bacteria that live in the environment
  * [this website](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/archaea.html) also introduces you to what the Archaea are – another domain of life that is usually lumped in together with the Bacteria (even though they are genetically very different!)

Ok, here are the steps to follow for this week:

**Step 1**: If you haven’t done so already, [send us message]({{"/contact-us" | absolute_url}}) to let us know which microbe you want to adopt.

**Step 2**: visit the website linked below for your adopted microbe.  This website will provide you with a lot more details about your microbe.  It will also provide suggestions for other things you could look up and read if you want more information.

**Step 3**: After you’ve read that information, you might have some questions about your microbe, or about microbes in general.  For example, here are some of the questions that were asked last year.  Please contact us to _send 1-2 questions about your microbe_ that you would like to have answered.  Silly and serious questions are both welcome!

**Step 4**: Based on the pictures of your microbe on the Internet, make a _3D model of your microbe_, using balloons, play dough, or whatever material you would like to use.  Don’t forget to accessorize your microbe!  Does your microbe have flagella to help it swim?  What could you add to your microbe to indicate flagella?  Does your microbe make nanowire structures?  What could you add to ![20100730_02]({{"/assets/20100730_02-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} make nanowires?  What about texture?  If you want your microbe to eyes and mouth, that is OK, too.  If you want to get really fancy, you could also make a habitat for your microbe, like using foil or paper to make a hydrothermal vent.  Be creative!  If you need inspiration, here are [some examples](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe/project-updates/balloonmicrobes) that were made during past Adopt A Microbe projects.

NOTE: if you would like to make your own play dough – here is a website with instructions on how to make your own with ingredients from the kitchen (<http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Playdough-Play-doh/> )

**Step 5**: Take a picture of your microbe and email a copy to <deepmicrobe@gmail.com> by **Monday, September 19, 2011**, along with the questions about your microbe.
