Greetings deep biosphere enthusiasts! At long last, we are happy to present the art work for the world's deepest art installation! Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourself for some awesomeness!!

But wait, before we begin, let me give you a little background. As you probably know if you've been following the Adopt A Microbe website, we had announced an [art contest]({{"/2011/08/23/art-contest-for-the-next-adopt-a-microbe-project/" | absolute_url }}) at the beginning of the project. We were looking for black/white artwork that we could transform into stencils for decorating the well-head of the CORK seafloor observatories.  These pieces of equipment are being placed at the bottom of the ocean at our study site in the Atlantic Ocean, which is at about 4500 meters below sealevel. Hence, the world's deepest art installation! The idea for this project was spawned from an expedition last year to deploy CORKs in the Pacific Ocean, which are at about 2650 meters below sea level. As an example, here is a picture of one of those CORKs as viewed from a remotely operated submersible.

We had hoped to officially announce the art work a few weeks ago, but we had some problems with out first deployment. Last night we successfully deployed another CORK experiment at the bottom of the ocean! This CORK sits at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean at 22 degrees 45.3531&#8242; N / 46 degrees 4.8911&#8242; W, at 4494 meters below sea level.

Without further ado, here are some of the winner entries for the contest, and their stencil counterparts!

&nbsp;

First up, we have designs from two rock start students from Saginaw High School.  Shannon C. sent in this awesome squid:

![P1060921]({{"/assets/P1060921-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

And Dakota S. sent in this stellar octopus design:

![P1060920]({{"/assets/P1060920-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Luke the Cyber Explorer submitted this creative concept of the world's longest necked giraffe (equipped with the world's longest snorkel!) exploring deep sea animals.

![P1060907]({{"/assets/P1060907-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Graduate student Mrina N. is interested in phages/viruses, as evidenced by this Pacman-like design:

![pacman]({{"/assets/microbia-MNikrad.jpg" | absolute_url }})

![P1060905]({{"/assets/P1060905-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

And the talented folks in the NASSA gang created a great design of the search for microbes.  Here is their description of the design:

_"We often discuss famous scientists and explorers in our after school science club.  One of the favorites in the story of Howard Carter.  He spent many years searching for King Tut's tomb.  When he finally got to look into the grave, everyone asked him, "What do you see?"  He responded, "I see wonderful things."  Our group thinks that deep sea researchers must feel like Howard Carter as they examine the deep sea cores.. They get to see "wonderful things" hidden among all of the dirt!!!!"_

![P1060906]({{"/assets/P1060906-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

[Dr. Glazer](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/letters-from-the-giant-microbes/newvideo-interviewwithbrianglazer), one of the scientists involved in using the CORK observatories to explore microbial activity in the deep subsurface, obviously knew that a mysterious kraken would [attack our first CORK deployment]({{"/2011/09/29/an-update-on-the-expedition-learning-from-failure/" | absolute_url }}), as evidenced by his design.

![P1060908]({{"/assets/P1060908-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

[Dr. Hulme]({{"/2011/09/30/meet-the-scientists-part-3/" | absolute_url }}), another one of the scientists involved in our work out here, created a design of his dog, Oki.

![P1060903]({{"/assets/P1060903-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Next up are three designs sent in by some of the amazing pilots and crew for the Jason ROV - one of the scientific [submersibles we use to work at our CORK observatories](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/letters-from-the-giant-microbes/newvideo-missionat18-07). Without them, the scientists would not be able to get any work done!

Here is a cheeky design of a 'weight stack' sent in by Sean K. A weight stack is a collection of metal plates used by the ROV to balance buoyancy during operations underwater.  We leave quite a few of these on the seafloor when we do work arounf the CORKs.

![P1060922]({{"/assets/P1060922-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Then there is the Penguoctopus Benthos designed by Wayne R.

![P1060917]({{"/assets/P1060917-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

And finally, a portrait of Jason pilot-in-training [Korey V. created by Scott H](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/letters-from-the-giant-microbes/onelastvideo-interviewwiththerovjasonteam). We are so stoked that his good lookin' mustachioed face will be staring at us while we are working at the seafloor!

![P1060918]({{"/assets/P1060918-1024x768.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Here are a few shots of the CORK assembly with the stencils, taken while we were assembling the experiment on the boat.  There is one additional stencil of one of our favorite Jason crew guys - can you find it?

Scientists will be visiting this CORK again in April/May 2012, which will be our first chance to take some pictures of the stencils underwater.  Stay tuned!  And big high fives to all of the artists that submitted artwork!
