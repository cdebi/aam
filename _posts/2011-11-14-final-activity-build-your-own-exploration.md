Microbe friends! Greetings from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean! Our scientific expedition to study microbial life deep in the oceanic crust is quickly coming to an end. Currently, we are powering to the northeast, headed to our port call in Ponta Delgada in the Azores. You wouldn't believe the hooting and hollering that went up around the ship when the news was passed around that we would arrive one day early. After more than two months at sea, everyone is desperately ready to see trees and land again!

So, maybe you noticed that we failed to post an activity last week. Sorry about that! Last week, the scientists were up to their eyeballs in hundreds of meters of sediment cores collected from nearly 5000 meters below sealevel! This meant that some us were spending about 16 hours a day standing in a refrigerated room measuring the chemistry of the long sediment cores. Brrr! Needless to say, that didn't leave much time for putting up new posts on the project website.

So, with the expedition wrapping up, that also means that we will wrap up this edition of the Adopt A Microbe project. The final activity will be a little more open-ended - you don't have to send anything in to us (unless you want to). The idea is to inspire you to try one of these projects over the next few weeks/months, and to see where that takes you.

One of the things we like best about science is exploration - getting to explore new places on Earth to uncover the secrets of life hidden there. Sometimes we need fancy tools to do our exploration, but often times simple tools can also do the trick. And as oceanographers, we wouldn't be able to anything without a roll of duct tape!

So, how can you be an explorer? Would you like to peer into the depths of the environment to search for microbes and other crazy forms of life? Well, here are two different projects you might want to dig into to help you in your quest.

**Project 1: build your own microscope**!

If you would like to see some microbes of your very own, just like some of the first microbiologists did way back in the day, check out these cool on-line projects to build your very own microscope:

here is a link to a story written by another guy that built his own microscope, too:

once you have your own microscope, you could try looking at some of the microbes growing in your Winogradsky column, or in some water from a nearby river or lake or ditch. Cool!

**Project 2: build your own robot submersible!**

And what better way to imagine microbes living at the bottom of the ocean than to go exploring yourself! There are several really cool guides and kits available on-line to help you build your very own robotic submersible, or ROV as we like to call them (which stands for Remotely Operated Vehicle). These robots could be used to explore rivers or lakes or the coast near you! Depending on your interest, you could buy most of the parts yourself at a local electronics shop and/or hardware store, or you can also buy pre-assembled kits online.

Here is a link to a bunch of online resources from the MATE Rover program:

Here is a link to a video put together by some folks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, along with step by step instructions for building an ROV:

_With these two project options, you can become an explorer, too! We hope that you have a lot of fun putting together your devices, and we would love to hear from you in the future to see what you have done with them. And we would like to thank you again for sending in your photos and drawings!  It was very cool for us to see your creative ideas about microbes!!  Thanks and high fives from the Atlantic Ocean!_
