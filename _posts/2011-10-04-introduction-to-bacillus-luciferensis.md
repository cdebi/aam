_Howdy microbe connoisseurs!  Today we have a special guest post from one of the other microbiologists on the expedition. Meet Dale Griffin, and learn about why an atmospheric microbiologist is sailing with us!_

Hello everyone! Well Beth has certainly picked some extremely interesting bacteria to put up for [adoption](/adoptamicrobe/?cat_ID=17). I am [Dale Griffin](https://profile.usgs.gov/professional/mypage.php?rfs=y&name=dgriffin), a microbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and I’m conducting atmospheric microbiology research onboard Expedition 336. Beth asked if I might be interested in nominating a bacteria for adoption so my nominee is _[Bacillus luciferensis](http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/52/6/1985.abstract)._

So why should I adopt _Bacillus luciferensis_? Well let me front-load the answer with some interesting trivia about the genus _Bacillus_. _Bacillus_ is typically the most populous genus found in terrestrial soils. _Bacillus_ species have also been found in deep marine sediments at depths of over 800 meters. They were also discovered in a drilling core that was collected at a depth of over 1500 meters below the seafloor off the coast of Brazil. Most interesting is that _Bacillus_ species form spores that are egg-like vesicles that allow them to survive during periods of harsh environmental conditions (like UV radiation exposure … sunburn anyone!). In an experiment conducted on the exterior of a NASA spacecraft in the 1980s a _Bacillus_ species survived for over five and a half years while exposed to the rigors of space. Interesting genus isn’t it. _Bacillus_ is everywhere and capable of surviving in some of the harshest environments imaginable.

OK, well enough trivia about the genus, what about _Bacillus luciferensis_? When was _Bacillus luciferensis_ discovered? Would you believe only about 11 years ago? Where was _Bacillus luciferensis_ discovered … OK, this gets interesting and perhaps a bit coincidental. _Bacillus luciferensis_ was discovered in volcanic soils collected from Lucifer Hill (do you see how it got its name?), which is located on Candlemas Island, South Sandwich Islands. Here is the coincidental part … Candlemas Island was discovered by Cpt. James Cook on Candlemas Day (Feb 2<sup>nd</sup>) 1775 while aboard the HMS Resolution (and we are aboard the JOIDES Resolution … neat).

Now, why am I nominating _Bacillus luciferensis_ for adoption? I found live cells of _Bacillus luciferensis_ at an altitude of 20 kilometers over the continental United States with the help of one of NASA’s high altitude research planes a number of years ago. Any idea how these cells got to that altitude? Perhaps a volcanic eruption? However those cells arrived at that altitude it is amazing that they survived for however long they were there and I will certainly be interesting if I find _Bacillus luciferensis_ in the atmosphere at our mid-Atlantic research sites. So think about adopting this little know and interesting microorganism … it has been found in soil, high in Earth’s atmosphere and it wouldn’t surprise me if we find it in the deep sea sediments that we will be collecting during IODP Expedition 336.
