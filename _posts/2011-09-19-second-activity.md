Yarrrr, me hearties! It be International Talk Like A Pirate Day! We be hopin’ that ye landlubbers be enjoyin’ yer-selves with th’ wee microbe adoptin’.

Ok, that is probably too hard to keep up for a whole post, so we be convertin’ back to the queen’s English for now.

_Before we get started describing this week’s adoption activity, this is just a quick reminder to send an email to deepmicrobe{at}gmail.com with pictures of your [project from week 1]({{"/2011/09/12/first-activity/" | absolute_url }}) – they are due today._

![P1060579]({{ "/assets/P1060579-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} This week’s activity will introduce you to some of the glorious microbes that you can find in the environment, and it will also teach you about how scientists on this expedition will be exploring for microbes at the bottom of the ocean. During this expedition, [after the observatories are installed](/adoptamicrobe/?p=366), the scientists will be up to their elbows (maybe even up to their eyeballs!) in sticky mud from the bottom of the ocean. [Long cores of sediment](http://joidesresolution.org/node/266) will be collected so that the scientists can slice them up to look for new microbes. As you may remember from an [earlier post]({{"/2011/09/14/introduction-to-thiomargarita/" | absolute_url }}), microbes like _Thiomargarita_ were first discovered in stinky muddy sediment. Although we don’t expect to find _Thiomargarita_ in the sediments that we will collect (because there won’t be enough sulfide in the mud to keep _Thiomargarita_ happy), we are sure to find some other cool microbes.

![Winogradsky]({{ "/assets/Winogradsky-208x222.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} In honor of all of the mud microbes that we hope to find, for this week’s activity, **you will be going out into the wilds around your home to explore for mud microbes of your own**! The plan for this week is to collect a short core of sediment from a stream, river, lake, or ocean (or even drainage ditch) near you, and then you will try to ‘grow’ your own microbes in world-renowned "[Winogradsky Columns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winogradsky_column)”!

What is a Winogradsky Column, you wonder? Well, it is an experiment named after a clever guy – Mr. Sergei Winogradsky – who was interested in studying soil microbes about a century ago. He came up with the slick idea of incubating soil and mud with some yummy carbon and sulfur sources to see how the microbes would respond. What results after a few weeks of incubation is a beautiful mixed community of microbes living together, including pretty purple, green, and white bacteria.

In the experiment, mud from the banks of a stream, river or lake is mixed with some shredded newspaper (the carbon source, in the form of cellulose) and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs (the sulfur source – which is why rotten eggs smell so bad) and then placed in a tall and skinny container with a little bit of water on top.  Over time, the microbes will eat up a lot of the oxygen in the mud, and the bottom of the container will become “anoxic” or oxygen free. Since the top of the container is open, oxygen can still seep into the upper parts of the container. Depending on their need for oxygen and the other food in the mud, different microbes will begin to dominate different depths in the container. You will be able to see this separation over time (3-6 weeks) as the microbes start to grow really thick into bands of different colors.

_Ready to get started growing your own mud microbes?!_

Things you will need:

  * a glass container, such as a Mason jar or a clean pasta sauce jar
  * an empty plastic bottle with a lid (like a soda bottle)
  * a bucket or bowl to collect mud into
  * a hand-shovel or large spoon to scoop mud with
  * plastic wrap (like you would use for wrapping up leftovers)
  * rubber band
  * the yolk of a hard boiled egg
  * a handful of shredded newspaper
  * a well-lit spot where you can leave the container for a few weeks (but not in direct sunlight)
  * a camera, to take pictures of your sample collection

**Step 1:**

First, watch this great [5-minute video](http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/projects/astrobiology/fieldwork/lessons/demo.html) made by NASA Quest that will give you an overview of setting up your own Winogradksy column.

**Step 2:**

Take the bucket, spoon/shovel and one of the plastic bottles to the bank of a nearby stream, river or lake. Taking care not to fall into the water or get stuck in the mud, scoop up a few handfuls of mud into your bucket. Try to avoid mud with lots of roots or rocks. Take a picture of your sampling location and send a copy to us at deepmicrobe{at}gmail.com

**Step 3:**

Fill up one of the plastic bottles with water from the stream, river or lake. Close up the bottle and bring it and the mud bucket back home.

**Step 4:**

Add a handful or so of the shredded newspaper and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg to your mud bucket and mix it up with the spoon. You want the mud to have the consistency of a milkshake, so if you need more water, use the water you collected (but don’t use it all, you will need a little bit for the end).

**Step 5:**

Carefully add the mud mixture to the glass container, tapping it on a flat surface to squish out any trapped air bubbles. Fill the container two-thirds to three-quarters of the way up.

**Step 6:**

Pour a little bit of the water on top of the mud in the container, leaving about half an inch of space between the water and the top of the container.

**Step 7:**

Place a piece of plastic wrap over the container top and hold it in place with a rubber band.

**Step 8:**

Now your Winogradksy column is ready to start incubating. Store it somewhere in a well-lit room, but not in direct sunlight. Over a few weeks time, you should hopefully start to see development of thick colored bands with a slimy textures – these are different types of enriched microbes. In a few weeks, we will revisit your Winogradsky columns to use them for another activity. In the meantime, if you are curious about the different microbes that start growing in your Winogradsky Column, check out this [great website](http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/bi/2000/Winogradsky_Column/winogradsky_column.html) that gives lots of details. Or you can send us an email with your questions.


**_That be all fer now, mateys.  We be hopin' ye have a jolly good romp diggin' in that there mud!_**
