Hello microbe adopters!  Thanks for sending in the photos of your [week 5 projects](/adoptamicrobe/?p=676)! You have some very creative ideas abut how microbes might be living in sediments and rocks.

For the first part of the activity, you examined how water moves differently between sand and clay sediment types. Here is a picture that Saginaw High School rock stars sent in of their test.

This photo does a great job of illustrating how water moved faster through the sand than the clay.  As you can see, there is a lot more space between each grain of sand than there is in the clays, and this allows the water to disperse quicker.

For those of you that get your drinking water from an aquifer, what do you think an engineer would look for when trying to decide where to place a well to collect the water? Would the engineer want to tap into a sandy or clay-rich deposit underground?

We also asked you to think about whether microbes would like to live in sands or in clays. Some of you thought that the microbes would prefer to live on sand, because the faster water movement might mean that the microbes would come in contact with the food and nutrients that they need to grow. Some of you also thought that microbes living on sand would face the threat of being washed off the sand, and that they might need special adhesive properties to stay attached. Scientists around the world are studying different types of deep sea sediment to try to understand where the microbes would like to live, too. Stay tuned!

In the activity, you also performed some tests with three different types of rocks - basalt, pyrite, and calcite - to determine their chemical reactivity in acidic conditions. When basalt and pyrite were dipped in vinegar, nothing really seems to happen, but when you dipped the calcite in vinegar, you saw lots of little bubbles forming. These bubbles are carbon dioxide gas formed from the calcite mineral (which is calcium carbonate).

Deep under the seafloor, waters with different chemical compositions (some are acidic, some are neutral or basic; some have lots of gas while others don't, etc.) are circulating through the rocky crust. The combination of the water and the rocks might lead to interesting chemical combinations that microbes can take advantage of to get energy using [chemotrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotroph).

For the last part of the activity, we asked you to draw some pictures of what you thought microbes living on rocks or sands or sediments might look like. Here are some the entries you sent in:

First up, here are two entries from Saginaw High School of some microbes aggressively showing on some rocky material and some happy microbes living amongst different particles:

Here are two entries from the Neighborhood After School Science Association in NY of microbes living in water and on rocks (with a great drawing of the JR ship, too!):

The cool cats over at Trinity Lutheran also drew some very colorful images of microbes on great journeys, chowing down on rocks for dinner.

Thanks for all of the great drawings, everyone!

Finally, here is an update from Saginaw High School on some of their Winogradsky columns that were set up for the [week 2 project]({{"/2011/09/28/summary-of-week-2-activities/" | absolute_url}}). Check out some of the color development, fluffy layers of microbes, and bubbles being formed in their juicy columns - all evidence of microbial activity in the mud that they collected.

How do your Winogradsky columns look?

Don't forget - the [Week 6 activity]({{"/2011/10/17/week-6-activity-make-a-microbe/" | absolute_url }}) is due next Monday!
