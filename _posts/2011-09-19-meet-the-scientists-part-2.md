Everybody loves microbes! Look how happy everyone is to have their picture taken with SAM and Missy!! Continuing our [introductions from yesterday]({{"/2011/09/18/meet-the-scientists-part-1/" | absolute_url}}) – meet some more scientists!!

Here is [Joe Russell](http://www.pavilionlake.com/plrp-team/joe-russell.php), a graduate student from the University of Delaware. He's happily volunteered to be part of the "FLOCS sweatshop," helping other microbiologists to prepare hundreds of colonization experiments for placing below the seafloor. Thanks, Joe!

And no expedition would be complete or successful without the wonderful Laboratory Officers that help keep everything running. Meet Lisa Crowder and Tim Bronk, the Assistant LOs for our expedition.
