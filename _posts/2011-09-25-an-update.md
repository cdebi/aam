Greetings deep microbe lovers!  We've been extremely busy the last few days, assembling our experiments that will be lowered down to the bottom of the ocean. The microbiologists on board also eagerly pounced on the rusty corrosion features all over the recovered experiment that had been sitting at the seafloor for 13+ years.  They are interested to know which kind of microbes are responsible for the rust.
