Greetings microbe enthusiasts! We hope that you had fun collecting mud for your [week 2 Winogradsky columns]({{"/2011/09/19/second-activity/" | absolute_url}}). Don't forget to send in a picture of your sampling adventure - deadline today! You can email them to deepmcirobe [at] gmail.com

For this week's activity, you will do a little bit of math to learn about all of the awesome microbes at the bottom of the ocean, and about how scientists try to study life in the deep. Let's get started!

One of the reasons for [this expedition](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/return-to-northpond/about-the-expedition/) is to try to figure out which microbes are living in the hard rocky crust of the seafloor, and to understand what they are eating to survive and thrive. Although the oceanic crust is a huge undersea aquifer where microbes live, we know very little about them at this point. By comparison, some [clever scientists](http://www.pnas.org/content/95/12/6578.full) calculated that roughly 10 to the power of 30 (10^30, or 1 with 30 zeroes behind it) microbes are 'buried alive' in the deep oceanic sediments that blanket the rocky crust at the seafloor. That's a lot! Let's try a silly calculation.

_**Calculation set 1**: If we consider that each microbe is, [on average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria#Morphology), 1 micrometer in diameter, and that there are 10^30 microbes in deep sediments, how long would a string of sediment microbes be if you placed them end to end? Remember that 1 micrometer is 10^-6 meters, or 0.000001 meters.  Would this invisible string of microbes reach from the Earth to the Sun? Remember that the distance from the Earth to the Sun = 1 [astronomical unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) = ~1.5 x 10^8 kilometers or 1.5 x 10^11 meters._

In a way, the scientists on this ship are interested to know how long a string of microbes from the rocky oceanic crust would be in comparison to the string of sediment microbes. Are there more or fewer microbes living in the rocks at the bottom of the ocean? Are they the same types of microbes, or are they different? What are they doing? How does their little microbe life in the depths of the ocean affect our human lives way up on land? We want to know!

One way the scientists on this expedition are trying to answer those questions is by installing tricked out experiments below the seafloor to carefully spy on the microbes in their environment. First, we install what is basically a well into the seafloor, using the drilling ship JOIDES Resolution. We call these wells 'CORKs', because it is kind of like placing a cork into a hole in the seafloor to keep the ocean water from above from mixing with the water from down below. Here is a link to a video that explains what a CORK is.

Then, on the inside of the CORK, scientists will place a long string of instruments to collect water samples from the fluids circulating through the oceanic crust. These instruments are called 'OsmoSamplers' because they are powered by osmotic membrane pumps. Here is a link to a video to show you what an OsmoSampler instrument string looks like.

During our expedition, we hope to install a whole bunch of these OsmoSamplers below the seafloor. Prior to the cruise, the scientists had to spend a lot of time figuring out how many parts and materials would be needed for the experiments, so that everything could be ordered ahead of time and brought out to sea with us. Once we are out here in the middle of the Atlantic, we can't really head on over to the hardware store if we forgot something! Let's try some calculations to figure out how much stuff the scientists had to get.

_**Calculation set 2**: Each subseafloor experiment will require 10 different osmo pumps, 24 coils of Teflon tubing, and 3 coils of copper tubing. Considering that we hope to install nine different subseafloor experiments during this cruise, how many total pumps, Teflon coils and copper coils will we need? Next, if we consider that each coil contains 300 meters of spooled tubing, what is the total length in meters of Teflon and copper tubing that we will need? Finally, if each pump and coil requires two tubing fittings to connect to the other devices on the instrument string, how many total fittings will we need to bring?_

The pictures below may help you to visualize what these different parts look like, and the videos linked above will also help.
