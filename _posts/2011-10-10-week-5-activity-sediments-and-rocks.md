Greetings microbe adopters! This week's activities will teach you a little bit about the habitats where deep microbes live, and the different chemical and physical conditions they might experience. The activities will rely on some of the materials in the kits that you have hopefully already received in the mail. If you have not yet received your kit, please [send us a message]({{"/contact-us" | absolute_url}}) to let us know.

In the first activity, you will examine the difference in water movement between different sediment types. In deep marine [sediments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment), there are between one thousand to one billion microbial cells in every cubic centimeter of sediment.  These microbes are dependent on the delivery of chemicals through the sediments to find energy to grow, and these chemicals travel differently depending on the sediment types.

To explore these differences yourself, here is an activity for you to try.

**Step 1**: you will need one of the glass bottles in your kit, plus the bag of clay and the bag of sand, and some water.

**Step 2**: Pour about 1 inch-worth of clay in the bottom of the glass vial. Tap the vial on the table the settle the clay and compact it a little bit.

**Step 3**: Pour about 1 inch-worth of sand on top of the clay.

**Step 4**: gently add water to the top of the sand until you fill up the rest of the space in the vial.

**Step 5**: what do you notice about the water interacting with the sand and the clay? Does water move faster through one or the other? How do you think this impacts microbes that might live in sand versus clay?

**Step 6**: when you are done with your activity, the sand and clay can be dumped in the trash.

Deep microbes also live on rocks beneath the seafloor. Like sediment microbes, they are dependent on chemicals to gain energy. Some microbes can mine chemicals directly out of the rock, while others use chemicals in the water moving through the cracks in the rocks. Rocks have different reactivities - some release dissolved ions and gases out of the solid rock matrix at different rates. For example, both the [basalt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt) and [pyrite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite) rocks in your kit contain reduced iron.  Pyrite (fool’s gold) also contains a lot of reduced sulfur. Microbes could use the iron and sulfide out of these rocks to grow.

To explore the differences in rock reactivities, you will do a small experiment to examine the reactivity of your three rock samples - basalt, pyrite, and [calcite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite) - in relation to changes in [pH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH), or the concentration of hydrogen ions in fluids.

**Step 1**: in addition to the three rocks and the little Deep Earth Academy Hand Lens from your kit, you will need a small glass bowl or cup, a spoon, and about a tablespoon of vinegar from your kitchen. Since vinegar is kind of stinky, you might want to do this activity in a well-ventilated area. Vinegar is safe to handle, but make sure you have adult supervision when doing this, since you wouldn't want to get this stuff in your eyes.

**Step 2**: using the hand lens, have a good look at your three different rocks. Can you imagine microbes living on the surfaces of these rocks?

**Step 3**: pour about 1 tablespoon of vinegar into the glass bowl. Carefully drop the basalt into the vinegar. Do you notice anything happening? Remove the basalt and try again with the pyrite. Do you see anything now? Finally, replace the pyrite with the calcite. Do you notice something different when the calcite is in the vinegar? Considering that calcite is a solid compound of calcium and carbonate, and that carbonate changes under low pH (also known as acidic conditions) to carbon dioxide, what do you think is happening?

Now that you have done these two activities, try drawing a picture of what you think microbes living on rocks or in sediments would look like. Either scan the drawing, or take a picture of it, and send it to us by Monday, October 17, 2011 so that we can post it on the website. Also, tell us how your Winogradsky columns are doing.  Have you noticed any changes?
