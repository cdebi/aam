![]({{ "/assets/20100820_01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Greetings, Microbe Lovers!  Our team is getting ready for the upcoming cruise to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on the renowned *[JOIDES Resolution](http://joidesresolution.org/)*. Our expedition sets sail on 15 September from Barbados, and then we will return in mid-November to the wonderful islands of the Azores.

We have a lot of exciting activities plan for the next Adopt A Microbe project, which will begin again on September 11.  Have you seen all of the awesome [microbes up for adoption]({{ "/categories/#adoption-center" | absolute_url }})?  If you would like to adopt a microbe and follow along with us, head on over to the [contact page]({{ "/contact-us" | absolute_url }}) and send a message.

Stay tuned for more details!
