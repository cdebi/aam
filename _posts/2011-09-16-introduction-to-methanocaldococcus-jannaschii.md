Aloha microbe enthusiasts, and greetings from tropical Bridgetown, Barbados!  All of the scientists, technicians and crew have arrived for [Expedition 336 to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge](http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/midatlantic_ridge_microbio.html), and we set sail tomorrow morning.

![Methanococcus_6]({{ "/assets/Methanococcus_6-208x208.gif" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Before we do, though, I thought you might be interested to learn a little bit more about one of the exciting microbes [up for adoption](/adoptamicrobe/?page_id=263). Microbe adopters, meet [_**Methanocaldococcus jannaschii**_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=242)!

_Methanocaldococcus jannaschii_ is one a tough little microbe. As a [hyperthermophile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermophile), it likes to live in salty water that is 85 degrees Celsius (that’s about 185 degrees Fahrenheit), and it can even survive in water that is hotter than that. So, next time you are preparing a pot of boiling salty water to make some pasta, think about what it must be like to survive in such hot water!

![mjvent]({{ "/assets/mjvent-208x148.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} _M. jannaschii_ was first discovered back in the early 1980s by some scientists that collected water and sediment samples with the Alvin submarine from ‘white smoker’ chimneys at about 2600m below sea level on the East Pacific Rise, a mid-oceanic ridge in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Back then, hydrothermal vents had only recently been discovered at the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos, and scientists were very curious to know what kinds of life might be found in those ‘extreme’ environments. Specifically, they were very curious to find out if microbes might be involved in the formation of methane gas that was measured in the hot fluids spewing out of the seafloor. Sure enough, [some clever folks](http://www.springerlink.com/content/u8774k126821777x/) were able to grow _M. jannaschii_ is hot culture media that contained some salts and abundant hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases. _M. jannaschii_ gains energy from combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide and converting them into methane gas – a process called [methanogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenesis). One gas that _M. jannaschii_ does not like, though – oxygen. Even the smallest exposure of _M. jannaschii_ to oxygen in the air is bad news for these microbes (think of the [scene in the Wizard of Oz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7GJcKuVGm8) where the wicked witch of the west cries ‘I’m melting!’).

![mjanni]({{ "/assets/mjanni-208x66.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Some of our microbe adopters [have asked](/adoptamicrobe/?p=382) us what the little ‘string’ things are that seem to connect _M. jannaschii_ cells.  It turns out that these microbes have bundles of flagella – basically like little tails that the cells can whip about to ‘swim’.

Wondering about the name?  _Methanocaldococcus_ refers to the cells being small ball-shaped cells (“cocci”) that make methane, and the _jannaschii_ part is kind of like a family name, as the cells are named after the [late Holger Jannasch](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=10934&tid=282&cid=817&ct=163), a scientist that was involved in describing the hydrothermal vents.
