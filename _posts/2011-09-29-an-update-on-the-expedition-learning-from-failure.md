Well, folks, I have [sad news](http://joidesresolution.org/node/2094) to report. After a lot of optimism the past few days about the [CORK installation](/adoptamicrobe/?p=366), we encountered a really big snag yesterday morning. Due to a mechanical failure, the CORK we were installing at Hole 395A suddenly snapped in two. This means that the experiment that we were trying to do in the subseafloor will no longer work at this site. I gotta tell you, everyone was pretty depressed when the broken CORK top was brought back onto the ship late last night.

We are trying to stay optimistic, though. We still have a chance to install two other CORK observatories during our expedition, and these will still be very useful for studying the microbiology of the subseafloor at this place in the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, although the CORK hardware at Hole 395A is broken, the string of instruments (and the [OsmoSamplers I mentioned before]({{"/2011/09/26/3rd-activity-microbe-math" | absolute_url}})) is still inside the hole, and we may be able to 'fish' them out one day in the future. That would be really cool.

In the meantime, we are trying to learn as much as we can about what went wrong with the CORK so that we can prevent it from happening in the future.
