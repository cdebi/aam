Greetings microbe fans! We are slowly but surely making progress with preparing the next hole for our second [CORK observatory]({{"/2011/09/11/let-the-fun-begin/" | absolute_url }}). Hopefully in a day or so we will begin coring again, collecting more rocks from below the seafloor to explore the different kinds of microbes living on them.

In the meantime, we took some time out to take some group photos of the entire scientific party and crew on board this expedition. Here is a picture of most of the people on the boat (minus a few people that were still working on the rig floor or sleeping).

Here is a photo of all of the scientists. As you may notice, many of the scientists are wearing black shirts that say "MAINLY MICROBE". This is the t-shirt for the [Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations](http://darkenergybiosphere.org/) (C-DEBI), a National Science Foundation-funded Science and Technology Center that supports research to study life in the deep subsurface. Actually, one of the scientists modified a shirt to read "MERELY MICROBE" - can you spot which one?

What does 'mainly microbe' mean? Well, did you know that our bodies have more microbial cells than 'human' cells? So, each one us could be considered to be 'mainly microbe'!

Speaking of microbes, here is a picture of all of the different microbiologists that are on this expedition. We are a mixture of ages and nationalities, with scientists from the US, Norway, China, Japan, Denmark, and France.

And finally, here is a picture of the group of scientists that have been involved with designing and building the [CORK observatory experiments]({{"/2011/09/11/let-the-fun-begin/" | absolute_url }}).
