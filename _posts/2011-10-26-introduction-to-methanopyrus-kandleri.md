_Today's guest post comes from Steffen Leth Jørgensen, a scientist from Norway. Steffen is a microbiologist, and he is very interested in the different types of Archaea microbes that are living in the deep biosphere. Read on to learn about his favorite microbe - **Methanopyrus kandleri**._

The microorganism of the day should be placed in the “Microbial book of records” (if such a thing existed) as it is the most heat tolerant organism known to mankind. It is a so-called methanogen, a common name used for all microorganisms that produces methane. There are several ways that microorganisms can do this, but this particular species does it by using hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide. By doing so, it gains energy, which is used for growth and maintenance of the cell. All known methanogens belongs to the archaeal domain of life and are anaerobes, meaning that none of them likes to have oxygen in their environment.

_Methanopyros kandleri_ was first isolated from samples collected at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in the Gulf of California by the legendary Karl Stetter from Germany and members of his scientific group back in 1989 - 12 years later the whole genome of this species was sequenced and assembled. It is in many ways a remarkable organism - not only is it a primary producer that is completely independent of sunlight (not many microbes are), but it is also a temperature record holder. While its optimum growth temperature is 98°C (almost the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure), it is able to grow at 110°C!

But the amazement doesn't stop there - one specific strain (strain 116) isolated by Ken Takai and coworkers in Japan from a hydrothermal field at the Central Indian Ridge can grow under high pressure and temperatures up to 122°C. This is currently the world record for any organism on Earth. For the time being this temperature sets the upper limit for life, but actually it can survive several hours exposed to temperatures up to 130°C.

For the strain 116, the pressure needed to get it growing was 20 Mega Pascal, this is equivalent to 2000 bar and is close to the same pressure that this species encounters in its natural environment at 2000 meter water depth.  While high pressure is needed for the strain 116 to grow at this high temperature, it is not a true piezophile (pressure lover) as it will also grow at atmospheric pressure, but at lower temperature (110°).
