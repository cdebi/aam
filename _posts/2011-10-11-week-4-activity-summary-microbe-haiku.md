Howdy microbe friends!  Thanks for sending in your haiku about your adopted microbes for the [week 4 activity]({{"/2011/10/03/week-4-project-microbe-haiku/" | absolute_url }})!  We hope that you had a lot of fun working on them.

<br />
The microbe adopters from Nobel Middle School sent in a bunch of haiku about their adopted microbes, and about life in the deep ocean in general.

_Water is so warm, Like an acidic hot tub, Microbe, you’re home!_

_You think it’s extreme, To them it’s very cozy, How can they survive?_
{: style="text-align: right;"}

_Still a mystery, So many unknown creatures, It’s full of secrets_

_Funda eats sugar, To get energy like me, So, how about sweets_
{: style="text-align: right;"}

_You help us clean up, Oily spills that we have made, We are so grateful_

_Thriving in harsh parts, Extreme climates are for me, Where I like to be_
{: style="text-align: right;"}

_While Rodrigo eats, Other animals get hurt, Because of the oil_

_My microbe is blue, He lives in muddy places, Ew, it just farted_
{: style="text-align: right;"}

_It is green and blue, It resembles cute bubbles, And, it makes me laugh_

_Somewhat fat is this, Graceful marinobacter, Aquaeolei miss_
{: style="text-align: right;"}

_Don’t stop believin’, Hold onto that freezin’, ya, Hydraulic vents bipolar_

<br />

Luke the Cyber Explorer sent in a series of haiku about [_Mariprofundus ferrooxydans_]({{"/2011/09/12/first-activity/" | absolute_url}}):
