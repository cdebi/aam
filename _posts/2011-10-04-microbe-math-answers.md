Greetings, microbe and math lovers! We hope that you had fun trying to calculate the [Microbe Math problems]({{"/2011/09/26/3rd-activity-microbe-math/" | absolute_url}}) for last week’s activity. Here’s a shot of some of the Saginaw High School rock stars working on their calculations.

So, yeah, the calculations were kind of strange, but interesting to think about, right? Let’s see how you did.

**_Calculation set 1_**_: If we consider that each microbe is, [on average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria#Morphology), 1 micrometer in diameter, and that there are 10^30 microbes in deep sediments, how long would a string of sediment microbes be if you placed them end to end? Remember that 1 micrometer is 10^-6 meters, or 0.000001 meters. Would this invisible string of microbes reach from the Earth to the Sun? Remember that the distance from the Earth to the Sun = 1 [astronomical unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) = ~1.5 x 10^8 kilometers or 1.5 x 10^11 meters._

**Answers**: A string made up of all of the microbes in deep ocean sediments would be 10^24 meters long (10^30 x 10^-6 = 10^24). This string of microbes would definitely reach from the Earth to the Sun, as 10^24 meters is much, much longer than the distance between the Earth and the Sun (1.5 x 10^11 meters). Actually, the string of microbes could stretch back and forth from the Earth to the Sun nearly 7 trillion times (6.667 x 10^12)!!

**_Calculation set 2_**_: Each subseafloor experiment will require 10 different osmo pumps, 24 coils of Teflon tubing, and 3 coils of copper tubing. Considering that we hope to install nine different subseafloor experiments during this cruise, how many total pumps, Teflon coils and copper coils will we need? Next, if we consider that each coil contains 300 meters of spooled tubing, what is the total length in meters of Teflon and copper tubing that we will need? Finally, if each pump and coil requires two tubing fittings to connect to the other devices on the instrument string, how many total fittings will we need to bring? _

**Answers**: For our expedition, we brought out 90 osmotic pumps, 216 Teflon coils, and 27 copper coils. That equals 64,800 meters of Teflon tubing (over 40 miles of tubing!!) ands 8,100 meters of copper tubing (imagine how much 8.1 kilometers of copper tubing weighs! Our arms are so tired!). At a minimum, we will need at least 666 fittings to connect all of the devices together, but considering that sometimes we drop these small fittings, it is safer to bring a bunch of extras.

Now here is a shocking calculation for the scientists on board. In about 4-5 years, many of the scientists will come back to North Pond, to pick up all of the pumps and coils from below the seafloor. In order to get the water samples that have been collected into the coils, so that we can understand the chemistry of the water moving through the oceanic crust, we will have to cut up all of the tubing in roughly 1-meter-long intervals. Can you imagine how much time it will take to cut up 65 kilometers worth of Teflon tubing in 1 meter intervals, if it takes about 10 seconds per meter?!? We had better bring some good music to listen to on that cruise, to keep us entertained.

Thanks to everyone for sending in your calculations and shots of your activity sheets!

And check this out – here’s a shot of some of the Winogradsky columns after sitting around for a week or so that the cool cats over at Trinity Lutheran School sent in. See those little bubbles on the surface? I bet the microbes are making some gas!

_How do your Winogradsky columns look? Are you seeing any changes or activity in them? Feel free to send some photos of your Winogradsky column development to deepmicrobe [at] gmail.com._

Have fun writing lovely [haiku]({{"/2011/10/03/week-4-project-microbe-haiku/" | absolute_url}}) about your adopted microbes for this week's activity!
