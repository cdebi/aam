![Microbes_byBOrcutt]({{ "/assets/20100820_011-208x277.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Greetings, Microbe Lovers, and welcome to the start of the Adopt A Microbe Project Version 4.0!  The project will be focused on the soon-to-start scientific expedition to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean – more about that below.  We are so excited to be running another installment of the project, and we are thrilled that so many of your have signed up to follow along with our adventures.

We thought we would start of this project by giving you a little bit of background about what you can expect to learn and do during the project, and also on the science behind the expedition.  As always, if you have any questions, head on over the [Contact Us]({{ "/contact-us" | absolute_url }}) page to send us a message.

![Dehalococcoides]({{ "/assets/Dehalococcoides-208x104.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} First of all, what is the Adopt A Microbe project all about, anyway?  Well, as a participant in the project, you have [virtually 'adopted']({{ "/adoption-details" | absolute_url }}) one of the awesome microbes featured in the [Adoption Center]({{ "/categories/#adoption-center" | absolute_url }}).  All of these microbes have an important role to play in the environment at the bottom of the ocean (or in deep gold mines on land!).  Over the course of the next few weeks, you will be learning all about the cool things your microbe can do while you conduct a different science or art project each week.  By participating regularly in the weekly activities, you will be _eligible to win some sweet prizes_!  You will also learn how these microbes live their crazy lives at the bottom of the ocean through the blog posts, videos, and art we present on the website every day or so.  And hopefully you will also learn a little bit about what it is like to be a scientist, working on a big boat in the middle of the ocean for a few weeks at a time.

Maybe you are wondering why we are so interested in microbes living at the bottom of the ocean?  What's the big deal?!?  Well, did you know that there are more microbes living below the seafloor than there are anywhere else on Earth?!?  There is so much (microbial) life down there, but we barely have any idea of who the microbes are and what they are doing!  Unlike you and me, who need to breathe oxygen to get energy to live, microbes can 'breathe' all sorts of weird things, like the iron found in rocks, or methane gas, or rotten-egg smelling sulfide gas, to gain energy to live.  The activity of all of those microbes can have a big impact on the cycling of different elements in the ocean, so we need to study them to get a better understanding of what they are doing and how.

![TheJRandSam_byBOrcutt]({{ "/assets/P1040857-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} So, what's going to be happening on this expedition – what is so special about it, you wonder?  Well, a team of scientists will be heading out soon on the [_JOIDES Resolution_](http://joidesresolution.org/), a large ocean drilling vessel used by scientists to explore below the seafloor.  We will visiting a site just to the west of the [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge), a place where two seafloor plates are pulling apart from one another, and where new seafloor is being formed.  We are very curious to know what happens in that newly formed seafloor as it moves away from the ridge – what kind of microbes live in the rocks, do they change over space and time, what are they doing?  So many questions!  Unlike most other drilling expeditions that use a giant drill to dig down deep into the seafloor to collect continuous cores of sediments and rocks, a unique part of our scientific plan is to install deep sea wells – called **CORKs** – into the holes we drill.  We will be placing a bunch of scientific equipment into those wells to monitor life, chemistry, and physical changes in the subseafloor rocks for several years (maybe even decades!).  The process of drilling and installing these wells will take several weeks, and then the scientists will come back out to these sites about once every year for the next few years to change out their instruments.

_**Want to know more?  Of course you do!**_

![20100720_01]({{ "/assets/20100720_01-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Here is a cool video that was made that explains the kind of science we will be doing over the next few years.  This video was filmed at a sister study site in the Pacific Ocean, but a lot of the techniques and questions are the same. [Mission AT18-07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LxFt44sKFXE).

One of the chief scientists of our expedition – [Dr. Katrina Edwards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-_qEbMDLvM) of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles – also has a [blog over at Scientific American](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/2011/08/30/introducing-expedition-336-at-north-pond/) that will chronicle some of the work we are doing.  Her first post gives some more background about the site we will be at.

There will also be blogs from some of the other scientists, plus chances to sign up for live video connections with the scientists at sea, on the [website](http://joidesresolution.org/node/1983) for the _JOIDES Resolution_.

Curious to know more about seafloor spreading, and about how scientists do work on the _JR_?  There is a [cool activity](http://www.oceanleadership.org/education/deep-earth-academy/educators/classroom-activities/grades-5-8/an-expedition-to-the-seafloor/) that uses **Google Earth** available for free on the Deep Earth Academy website.

Finally, stay tuned – tomorrow (Monday) we will be posting the first activity for you to try out.

Back to packing up last minute things for the cruise,
