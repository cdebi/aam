Dear microbe adopters - we are terribly sorry for the inconvenience, but there will be a delay in the posting of the final microbe adoption activity. Sediment coring has begun on the JOIDES Resolution, and we are trapped in the cold room processing samples for 12+ hours a day, so there hasn't been time to finish writing up the activity. We'll get it posted as soon as possible.  Thanks for your understanding!
