Howdy microbe adopters! Don’t forget to send in the answers to your [microbe math calculations]({{"/2011/09/26/3rd-activity-microbe-math" | absolute_url }}) from last week’s activity!

This week’s activity is inspired, in part, by the multi-cultural experience of sailing on the JOIDES Resolution. The scientists and crew for the ship come from many different nations and cultures – you have already met some of them in [earlier posts]({{"/2011/09/30/meet-the-scientists-part-3/" | absolute_url }}). Part of the excitement on these cruises is getting to know new people and learning about their lives.

On this expedition, four of the scientists are Japanese. For example, here is Kasumi Sakata, a scientist from Osaka University studying [Organic Geochemistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_geochemistry).

In honor of our Japenese scientists, this week’s activity is to write a haiku about your microbe! What is [haiku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)? Haiku is a Japanese form of poetry. In western cultures, haiku has been translated into poems that contain three lines, where the first and last lines have five syllables, and the middle line has seven.

**Step 1**: Write a haiku about your microbe. It could be about any topic related to your microbe – for example, what your microbe eats, where it lives, what it looks like, etc. Silly or serious would be fine.

**Step 2**: Email a copy of your haiku to deepmicrobe [at] gmail.com by next Monday, October 10, 2011. Or, if you are feeling really inspired, maybe you could send a photo of your haiku written out next to the [microbe model]({{"/2011/09/21/summary-of-week-1-projects" | absolute_url }}) you made a few weeks ago.

To help you get those creative juices flowing, here are some example haikus written about life aboard the JR during this expedition, written by some of the scientists and crew. If you want more inspiration, check out [_Dissertation Haiku_](http://dissertationhaiku.wordpress.com/) – a website where young scientists sum up there scientific research into one simple haiku!

_Each day a challenge, Make it work with what you have, JR needs quick minds_

_Busy lives on board, Boring into the abyss, Old octopus smiles_

_Drill bits pierce darkness, new worlds unfold before our ... yay, coke machine fixed_

We can't wait to read the haiku that you come up with!  Stay tuned for tomorrow's post with the answers to the microbe math problems.
