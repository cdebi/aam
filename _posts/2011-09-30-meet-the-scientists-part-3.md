Greetings from the stormy Atlantic Ocean! We are currently chasing the tail end of Tropical Storm Phillippe, hoping to return to our study site by tomorrow morning to resume work. The ship is definitely moving around a lot more than before, and there are storm clouds in the distance putting on quite the lightning show.

Here on the inside of the ship, the scientists are keeping busy, writing reports, preparing experiments, checking on microbe cultures, and eating lots of food. Mmmmmm. We finally had a chance to wander around and introduce our microbes to a few more of the scientists - say hello!

It's Friday, which means it is Aloha Friday for Sam and Geoff, our resident Friday timekeepers in their Hawaiian shirts. Sam Hulme and [Geoff Wheat](http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/directory/faculty/wheat/) are both scientists from California (it's close to Hawaii, right?). They are both inorganic chemists, and they build the chemical samplers that we deploy in the CORK observatories.

Tania Lado Insua is a graduate student at the University of Rhode Island, although she is originally from Spain. She recently started [writing a blog](http://joidesresolution.org/blog/267) (in Spanish!) on the _JOIDES Resolution_ website - check it out! Coming soon, she will also be contributing some Spanish language translations for the Adopt A Microbe website - stay tuned!

Meet Kevin Grigar, CORK observatory engineer extraordinaire!  Kevin comes from Texas (with a great Texan accent!) and has been involved with designing and building CORKs for a couple of years now.  We would not be nearly as successful as we are in installing CORKs without his help.  Thanks, Kevin!

I say 'mighty microbe', you say 'Katrina Edwards'! Dr. Katrina Edwards - "[Mistress of the Dark World](http://www.laweekly.com/2010-05-20/la-life/katrina-edwards-mistress-of-the-dark-world/)" - is a professor from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and one of the co-chief scientists of this expedition. She is also the Director of the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations ([C-DEBI](http://darkenergybiosphere.org/)) Science and Technology Center, an organization that promotes research into the deep biosphere of microbes below the seafloor. She also [writes a blog](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/2011/09/27/north-pond-first-successes/) over at _Scientific American_ about our experiences on this cruise.

Next up is Amanda Haddad, a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Katrina Edwards. Amanda is interested in the microbes that live on rocks in the subseafloor, and she uses really cool microscopes to map out where different elements are in the rocks in relation to where the microbes live. She is also running an awesome website for special education classes - [the Classroom Connection](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/classroomconnection/) - check it out!
