_Howdy microbe connoisseurs! Today we have a special guest post from one of the other microbiologists on the expedition. Meet Feng-Ping Wang, and learn about her interest in life under pressure!_

Hello, my name is Feng-Ping Wang, and I am from Shanghai JiaoTong University. I work on microorganisms from deep-sea environments. Here, I want to tell you about a fascinating microorganism: _Pyrococcus yayanossi_ CH1, an archaeon who can only live in the deep.  It needs high pressure for growth, and could not survive under atmospheric pressure. Pretty cool bug, right?!

OK, let me first ask you what you think is the most common physical parameter in the deep environment? If you answered high pressure, you are absolutely right!! The average depth of the ocean is around 4000m, which corresponds to 40 Megapascal (MPa, 1 atmospheric pressure = 0.1 Mpa). We human beings definitely can’t survive in the deep, but many microorganisms can grow under high pressure.  Some can even grow much better in the high pressure condition than in the atmosphere condition (so called as “piezophiles”), and a few of them even rely on high pressure for growth (“obligate piezophiles”). Actually we know very little of these obligate piezophiles, nor their proportions in the deep microbial communities, as they normally do not survive when we get samples from the deep by routine sampling methods.

Now, let’s come to our nominee：_Pyrococcus yayanosii_ CH1, the only obligate piezophilic archeon isolated up until now. In March 2007, the hydrothermal field Ashadze 1 on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is the deepest active hydrothermal field known so far, was explored and studied during the French ”Serpentine” cruise with the ROV ”Victor 6000”. Several sulfide samples from black smokers were collected, and once onboard the ship, immediately distributed into syringes containing artificial seawater, reduced with Na<sub>2</sub>S and pressurized at 40 MPa prior to subsequent analysis in the laboratory. You see, high pressure storage is essential for the successful capture of the obligate piezophiles! After rounds of enrichment and selection procedures under pressure conditions in the laboratory, finally, here comes the strain CH1! The CH1 cells are highly motile irregular cocci with a diameter of about 1-1.5 um. Growth was observed only under strictly anaerobic conditions, over a temperature range of 80 to 108 °C and a pressure range of 15 to 130 MPa, with optima at 98°C and 52 MPa. The optimal growth pH and salt concentrations is 7.5-8 and 3.5 % NaCl, respectively. Under these optimal conditions, generation time was about 50 minutes. CH1 is a heterotrophic organism growing on complex carbon sources such as peptone, tryptone, yeast extract or beef extract. With appropriate carbon sources, growth was stimulated by elemental sulphur. CH1 represents the first obligate piezo-hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated so far, it extends the pressure/temperature limits for life. To express our appreciation of the great contribution from Prof A. Aristides Yayanos from Scripps Institute of Oceanography on the field of high pressure microbiology, the CH1 strain was later formally named as _Pyrococcus yayanossi_.

The isolation of CH1 gives scientists great opportunities to investigate and understand the strategies of life in the deep, such as how life adapts and thrives under high pressure: the most common physical condition on the earth. If extraterrestrial life exists, such as on Mars, life has to cope with high pressure, but how? …… Deep investigations on CH1 may give us some answers or clues.

At the end, I’ll leave you with a thought which may be interesting for you to know: the isolation of CH1 was achieved by the joint efforts of French and Chinese scientists. The French scientists from Brest and the Chinese scientists from Shanghai are continuing their collaborations, hoping to bring you more exciting news from CH1. More and more, scientists from different fields and nations are attracted by this amazing microorganism – we the messenger from the deep also attracts you.
