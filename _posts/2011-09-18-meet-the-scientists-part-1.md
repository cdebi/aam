Greetings microbe lovers!  Our expedition is finally underway!  The _JOIDES Resolution_ left Barbados yesterday morning, and we hope to arrive at our sampling location in two more days.  While we are underway, the scientists and technicians have been keeping busy, preparing the observatories that will be installed at the bottom of the ocean.


![AAMv4_SAM_Orcutt]({{"/assets/P1060615-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} We thought you might like to meet some of the cast and crew that you will be hearing about over the next two months during this expedition, so today we are starting some rounds of introductions.

First off, meet S.A.M. (Super Awesome Microbe), a veteran microbe of observatory expeditions.  You will be seeing a lot of SAM over the next few weeks, as s/he loves to be photographed all around the ship.

![AAMv4_SAM_Wolfgang]({{"/assets/P1060621-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-left} To start with, here we see SAM with [Wolfgang Bach](http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/FB5/Ozeankruste/index.htm), one of the co-chief scientists of this expedition.  Wolfgang joins us from the University of Bremen in Bremen, Germany.  He is a [petrologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrology), which means that he studies rocks from the bottom of the ocean to understand what minerals they are made of and how they were formed.  Along with [Katrina Edwards](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe3/letters-from-the-giant-microbes/newvideo-interviewwithdrkatrinaedwards), he is responsible for the overall scientific plan for this expedition.


![AAMv4_SAM_Adam]({{"/assets/P1060618-208x156.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} Here is SAM and another microbe named Missy hanging out with Adam Klaus (left) and Steve Midgley, two very important people on this expedition.  Adam comes from Texas A&M University and he is the Staff Scientist, which means that he is responsible for keeping all of the rest of the scientists up to date on activities and keeping us on task.  Steve also joins us from Texas, and he is the Operations Superintendent for our expedition.  His job is to make sure that all of the technical details of the expedition are taken care of, such as figuring out how long every operation will take.

We will continue the introductions over the next few days.  If there is a scientist that you would really like to ask a question to, you can post it here in the comments section.

Just a reminder to those of you participating in the project – the [first week’s activity]({{"/2011/09/12/first-activity/" | absolute_url}}) is due tomorrow (Monday).  We will also be posting the second activity tomorrow, so stay tuned!
