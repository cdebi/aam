Greetings, microbe fanatics!

We are on day three of our operations to collect cores of rock from the bottom of the ocean.  The scientists have been working around the clock to sample the rocks, preserving them in many different ways to study the microbes that might be living on them. Here is a link to a blog post written by Jennifer, the education specialist on our expedition, about the excitement of the first 'core on deck':

And here is a an update from Katrina, one of the chief scientists of this expedition, about how we are progressing through our scientific objectives and overcoming challenges of work at sea:

Curious to know more about how we collect core?  Check out this recent post by Amanda, one of the graduate students on this expedition:

Jennifer also recently put together a great short film documenting the work we were doing last week, assembling the ill fated CORK observatory for deployment at the bottom of the ocean.

Although we've been very busy working on the cores, some of the scientists took a little creative break to write their own haiku, like you are doing for [this week's activity]({{"/2011/10/03/week-4-project-microbe-haiku/" | absolute_url}}).  Here are some of the gems they have come up with:

_The best hole ever<br />
thirty years of seafloor dreams<br />
now plugged with a CORK_

_Nightshift is over<br />
Core is on deck at sunrise<br />
There's nothing like it!_
{: style="text-align: center;"}

_Life in the abyss<br />
Water flows and microbes rule<br />
We drill for the thrill_
{: style="text-align: center;"}

\- Wolfgang B.

_It's my first boarding.<br />
My worries changed to smiles.<br />
Thank you for many kindness._

心配が<br />
笑顔に変わった<br />
初乗船

_The blue blue moon pool<br />
Feeling like swallowed up in<br />
To dark cryptic sphere_

_What colorful cores<br />
Come up from the depths below<br />
Alteration rocks!_
