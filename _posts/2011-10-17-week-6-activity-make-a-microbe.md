Howdy microbe adopters! Have you been wanting your own cute and cuddly Giant Microbe like SAM to keep you company? Well, your wait is over – this week’s activity is to make your very own giant plush microbe! Now when you tell your friends about how cool your adopted microbe is, you can show them your very own Giant Microbe.

Our good friend and amazing seamstress [Katie Inderbitzen](http://joidesresolution.org/blog/53) – a graduate student from the University of Miami studying the pressure of the deep subsurface - has prepared some fabric patterns for us to make our own spherical and bean shaped fabric microbes. You can use these as templates for making your own giant microbes, or feel free to make a giant microbe in the shape of your choosing. These templates involve the use of glues that you can find at a local craft store, but feel free to try sewing or using other means of making your microbe (duct tape, anyone?). Be as creative as you want in your choice of fabric and styling! Eyes, tails, mouths, and other bits of flare are all welcome.

Download the following files for directions and patterns for making your own fabric microbes. You might need to make a run to the craft store to get fabric and stuffing (although old shirts and pillow stuffing work well, too).

[AAM_FabricMicrobe_Bean2]({{"/assets/AAM_FabricMicrobe_Bean2.pdf"}}): bean-shaped microbes like [_Mariprofundus_](/adoptamicrobe/?p=228)

[AAM_FabricMicrobe_Coccoid]({{"/assets/AAM_FabricMicrobe_Coccoid.pdf"}}): sphere-shaped microbes like [_Thiomargarita_]({{"/2011/09/14/introduction-to-thiomargarita/" | absolute_url }})

Take a picture of your microbe and send it to us by **Monday, October 24**. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask!

(if you have a hankering for buying a commercial Giant Microbe, you can do that [here](http://www.giantmicrobes.com/us/main/giantmicrobes-originals/), or at many science museums.  Disclaimer - we have nothing to do with the companies that sell these products).
