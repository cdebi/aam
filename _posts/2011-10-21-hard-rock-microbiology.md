Greetings microbe fans! We are busy preparing the next site for another subseafloor observatory, which we hope to install in the coming weeks. In the meantime, microbiologists on board the ship are staying busy, continuing to work on cultures that were started using some of the rocks we collected last week.

Would you like to learn more about how we collect our samples, and what they look like? Check out this new video about hard rock microbiology that was just made for our expedition.
