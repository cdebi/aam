Ready to Adopt A Microbe??  Here are some things you should know.
{: .notice--info}

## What does 'adopting' a microbe really mean?? ###

**Microbe adoption is virtual – we will NOT be sending you real microbes in the mail!**  When you send us a message that you want to participate, you are basically indicating that you are interested in following along with our weekly web-based activities to learn more about microbial life in the deep ocean.  The project activities are designed with young kids in mind, but hopefully even adults will find them entertaining.  Participation is totally voluntary.

As an example, check out one of our [previous Adopt A Microbe projects](https://sites.google.com/site/adoptamicrobe/).

## How does the adoption work?

  1. Check out our [Adoption Center]({{ "/categories/#adoption-center" | absolute_url }}) to find out which microbes are up for adoption.  Please note that each microbe can be adopted by multiple persons/groups.
  2. Send us a [message]({{ "/contact-us" | absolute_url }}) to tell us who you are (if you want to use a class or team or avatar name, that would be awesome!), where you are coming from, how to get in touch with you, and which microbe you want to adopt.  **the first 30 groups to sign up will receive a free kit with materials for the project – supplies are limited! Please sign up by September 17, 2011.** (Please note that we won't share your information with anyone else, but by participating you are agreeing to allow any photos or other media that you send to us to be posted on the web.  Note: if the contact form doesn't work, you can just send an email to deepmicrobe@gmail.com)
  3. Visit the Adopt a Microbe website often during the course of the project (September 11 – November 19, 2011) to learn about the weekly activities, watch awesome new videos, read our hilarious blogs about life in the deep biosphere, and giggle at our daily shenanigans while sailing the high seas onboard the RV Atlantis.
  4. Every Monday, we will post a new activity for you to complete (don't worry – it will be fun!).  Every Thursday, send us your creative projects. Regular participants will be entered into a raffle to win one of our ridiculously awesome prizes!

## Some things you may need:

  * an internet connection
  * a digital still and/or video camera
  * arts and crafts stuff – balloons, markers, paint, tape, glue, fabric, play dough … you get the idea
